<font size="3">*Research Overview*</font>
<p>I am a broadly trained fisheries and wildlife ecologist focused on high latitude coastal and pelagic marine ecosystems (Pacific northwest and Alaska, western Antarctic Peninsula). My research interests lie at the intersection of evolution, ecology, and physiology, thus I take integrative approaches to understanding factors that shape animal behavior, fitness, and population dynamics to inform management and conservation actions. **The overarching goal of my work is to develop genes to ecosystem perspectives on a diversity of animal systems**, some of which are critically important for commercial fisheries and subsistence harvests. I incorporate modern, quantitative methods in my work, and strive to inspire students to develop their own quantitative and communication skills to train the next generation of conservation ecologists. I also seek to inspire the public's interest in nature and understanding of the scientific process. I am always looking for new collaborators and students to join my program, please reach out if you have interest in my work. Thanks for stopping by!
