<P>*I respectfully acknowledge Alaska's First Peoples and their long history of*
<br>*living in deep connection with their land and water, and the historical and*
<br>*ongoing legacy of colonialism. As a life-long student, I am committed to*
<br>*learning about injustice, and working to improve equity in my professional*

<font size="3"><b><i>Research Overview</b></i></font>
<p>I am a broadly trained fisheries and wildlife ecologist focused on high latitude coastal and pelagic marine ecosystems (Pacific northwest and Alaska, western Antarctic Peninsula). My research interests lie at the intersection of evolution, ecology, and physiology, thus I take integrative approaches to understanding factors that shape animal behavior (foraging, breeding, toxicology/disease, and movement ecology), fitness (including associated life history traits and trade-offs), and population dynamics (demographic rates and population structure) to advance basic knowledge and inform management and conservation actions. **The overarching goal of my work is to develop molecule to ecosystem perspectives focusing on the integrative evolutionary ecology of animal systems**, some of which are critically important for commercial fisheries and subsistence harvests. I incorporate modern, quantitative methods in my work, and strive to inspire students to develop their own quantitative and communication skills to train the next generation of conservation ecologists. I also aim to enhance the public's interest in nature and understanding of the scientific process. I am always looking for new collaborators and students to join my program, please reach out to me if you have interest in my work - a few recent papers are noted below. Thanks for stopping by!
